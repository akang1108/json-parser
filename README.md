# JSON Parser

## Notes
* This is an experimental project for my learning purposes with Antlr4, grammar, and parsing.
* Example is to parse a json file and create a Java object representation.
* Implemented Visitor classes to handle creating a Json object from a ParseTree.
* TODO: Implement same functionality with Listener(s)

## Build and run tests
